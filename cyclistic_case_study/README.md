# Key Business Intelligence Documents. 

In the realm of Business Intelligence, three fundamental documents serve as the cornerstone of the process: Stakeholder Requirement Documents, Project Requirement Documents, and Strategy Documents. These three documents work together to ensure that BI solutions are:
- Aligned with business needs.
- Technically sound and actionable.
- Scalable and strategic.

## Stakeholder Requirements Document

**Purpose:**
Identifies and captures the business requirements, expectations, and success metrics from key stakeholders (executives, managers, end-users, etc.).
The Stakeholder Requirements Document enables you to capture stakeholder requests and requirements so you understand their needs before planning the rest of the project details or strategy. It should answer the following questions:
- Business problem: What is the primary question to be answered or problem to be solved?
- Stakeholders: Who are the major stakeholders of this project, and what are their respective job titles? 
- Stakeholder usage details: How will the stakeholders use the BI tool?


**Key Elements:**
- Stakeholder Identification: Who the stakeholders are and their roles
- Business Objectives: What the stakeholders hope to achieve through BI
- KPIs & Metrics: The key performance indicators or metrics that matter to them
- Preferred Visualizations: Charts, graphs, or dashboards, they expect to see
- Reporting Needs: Frequency (e.g., real-time, weekly) and delivery method (dashboard, PDF, email, etc.)
- Pain Points: Current challenges with data, access, or decision-making
- Primary requirements: What requirements must be met by this BI tool for this project to be successful? 

Once you have established the stakeholder requirements, you can start thinking about the project requirements that need to be met to achieve the stakeholder requirements.

## Project Requirement Document

**Purpose:**
Provides a comprehensive summary of the technical and functional specifications required to complete the Business Intelligence (BI) project, drawing upon the valuable insights and requirements provided by the stakeholders.


The Project Requirements Document contains the following details: 
- Purpose: Briefly describe why this project is happening and explain why the company should invest its resources in it.
- Key dependencies: Detail the major elements of this project. Include the team, primary contacts, and expected deliverables. Are there any inter-team deliverables required? 
- Stakeholder requirements: List the established stakeholder requirements, based on the Stakeholder Requirements Document. Prioritize the requirements as: R - required, D - desired, or N - nice to have.
- Success criteria: Clarify what success looks like for this project. Include explicit statements about how to measure success. Use SMART criteria. 
- User journeys: Document the current user experience and the ideal future experience. 
- Assumptions: Explicitly and clearly state any assumptions you are making. 
- Compliance and privacy: Include compliance, privacy, or legal dimensions to consider. 
- Accessibility: List key considerations for creating accessible reports for all users. Who needs to access this feature? How are they viewing and interacting with it? 
- Roll-out plan: Briefly describe the expected scope, priorities and timeline. Consider at what points during the rollout will measurements be made to determine whether the feature is performing as expected? Is there a rollback plan and timeline if this feature does not meet its intended goals?


**Key Elements:**
- Data Sources: What systems or databases the data will come from (e.g., CRM, ERP, spreadsheets)
- Data Fields: Specific fields required (e.g., customer ID, revenue, date of purchase)
- Data Transformations: Any cleaning, filtering, joining, or aggregations needed
- Security Requirements: Access levels and data privacy considerations
- Tooling & Platforms: Technologies to be used (e.g., SQL, BigQuery, Tableau, Looker)
- Timeline & Milestones: Key deadlines and delivery phases
- Testing & Validation Criteria: How outputs will be verified

Similar to the stakeholder requirements document, the project requirements document will vary depending on the complexity of the project.


## Strategy Document

**Purpose:**
Defines the long-term business intelligence vision, governance structure, and alignment with the business strategy. This is the final phase of the planning process. The strategy document is a collaborative place to align with stakeholders about project deliverables. This is a time to flesh out what metrics will be required, how metrics are calculated, and any limitations or assumptions that exist about the data. Stakeholders consider these details and assist the BI professional in making final project decisions. Then, the BI professional provides stakeholders with a dashboard mockup to get valuable feedback

**Key Elements:**
- BI Vision & Goals: The “big picture” for how BI supports decision-making
- Data Governance Plan: Policies for data quality, ownership, and access
- Tool & Tech Stack Strategy: What tools will be adopted, standardized, or retired
- Scalability & Maintenance Plan: How to ensure the solution grows with the business
- Training & Adoption: How users will be trained and supported
- Change Management: How updates and improvements will be managed over time
